# Twitt-Block

Twitt-Block is a social commentary about Twitter and its chief twit, Elon Musk.  As a father and husband, I've experienced firsthand the worst that Twitter has to offer.  I've spent many sleepless nights consoling loved ones who were facing the wrath of Twitter masses because they had a differing opinion, and I've spent time and money dealing with the ramifications of being "doxxed".  

But, when some thin-skinned rich twit with an over-inflated sense of self-importance comes along fires all but the most die-hard fanboys (and those who are enslaved by their H1B visas), and re-instates banned individuals solely for his entertainment because he is the *smartest man alive*. And when this thin-skinned individual turns a blind eye when his "free-speech" platform turns into a cesspool of racist drivel and conspiracy theories, I have to take a stand. 

	"What's wrong with you? Do you hate free speech and America?"

**No! Not at all!  I'm proud to be an American.**  I feel so lucky that as Americans, we have the freedoms that we do.  If I call out my senator for speeding down the highway and taking a photo of his odometer with his phone [LINK](file://JerryMoranOdometer.png), I don't need to worry about being sent off to a hard-labor camp as a political dissident.  

I value the first amendment and I respect your freedom to invoke your first amendment rights as you see fit.  [However, the first amendment is *not* absolute](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/959/fighting-words).  The first amendment does not give Americans cart blanc to say whatever they want, whenever they want.  The first amendment also does not guarantee that your opinion *must or will be heard.* I do not expect that you will listen to anything I have to say. (I am married and a father, I'm used to being ignored.)

Unlike Winston in the George Orwell book "1984", you can turn off the TV, you can change the channel on the radio, you can choose what books you and your family read and don't read, and can choose the social media platforms you wish to participate in. 

I no longer wish to be part of Twitter, I don't see its value and I no longer want to be subject to hate speech or conspiracy theories, or bullied by someone with more followers. I do not care what a billionaire says or does, I just don't.  Mr. Musk and Twitter are not worth my time, he certainly doesn't need my financial support; so I created Twitt-Block. 

Twitt-Block is a simple content blocker, that simply blocks Twitter.com. *Why?* Because, as I've said, I don't want to see the hate speech that Elon says is so valuable for social media like Twitter, and although I've stopped visiting Twitter, I do have friends and family that insist on sharing tweets and memes, and I just don't want to see it.


## Installation
Twitt-Block is being made available in source form because I don't want to face the ire of angry Musk Fanboys who feel I'm disrespecting Twitter and Mr. Musk for some sort of gain.  I'm not, I don't care about him or his platform.

If you are a braver individual than I am, feel free to make a build and release it on the AppStore.
